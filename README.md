# Prim's algorithm

Implementation of Prim's algorithm to obtain the minimum spawning tree of a graph.

The algorithm is applied in a "social network" to identify groups of people who, based on a similarity index, share the same interests. This group of people must be represented in a Graph and the interests as an integer between 1 and 5.
